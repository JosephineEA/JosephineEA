### Welcome to my GitHub! 
I'm currently an undergraduate at Central South University, majoring in Infomation Management and Infomation System. The following 3 projects show my experiences and abilities about data science and management infomation system:

**[ThePeoplesDailyLDA](https://github.com/JosephineEA/ThePeoplesDailyLDA)** is a natual language processing project that crawled news on the People's Daily for one year and used LDA model to analy their topics.

**[StudyRoomMIS](https://github.com/JosephineEA/StudyRoomMIS)** is a Java web project with tech stack using MySQL, SSM(Spring+SpringMVC+Mybatis) and JSP.

**[Wave-SandcastleCA](https://github.com/JosephineEA/Wave-SandcastleCA)** is a matlab project for a cellular automata based wave-sandcastle model for MCM/ICM 2020 B.

Now I'm looking forward to gain opportunities for further study, because I really want to explore interest of big data! :smiley:
